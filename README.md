*** Project Description ***
This is a coding competition by Roche to implement FizzBuzz REST Server. The server should expose a REST API endpoint, with the additional feature of a statistical endpoint.
Fizz-Buzz Logic
The Fizz-Buzz algorithm involves replacing all multiples of 3 with "fizz", all multiples of 5 with "buzz" and all multiples of 15 with "fizzbuzz". Your output should look like this:

Example: â€œ1,2,fizz,4,buzz,fizz,7,8,fizz,buzz,11,fizz,13,14,fizzbuzz,16,..."
